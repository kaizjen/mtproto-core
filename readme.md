# mtproto-core

## This is a fork of [alik0211/mtproto-core](https://github.com/alik0211/mtproto-core).
The purpose of this fork is to have up-to-date TL schema for [Telekite](https://telekite.vercel.app). Maybe, in the future, also have it operate on `BigInts` instead of `strings` for performance.
